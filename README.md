Collection of scripts for analysis of fetal immune atlas (see our [preprint]())

## Contents

* [`src`](https://github.com/emdann/Pan_fetal_immune/edit/master/src) contains scripts and notebooks used for data processing and analysis.
* [`metadata`](https://github.com/emdann/Pan_fetal_immune/edit/master/metadata): contains metadata relevant for sample and cell annotations, pointers to raw and processed data, color palettes and groupings.
<!-- * `legacy_code`: old notebooks and scripts that have been refactored in the main analyses, but worth keeping to retain useful snippets
* `thrash_n_snippets`: discarded code not included in main analysis
 -->
