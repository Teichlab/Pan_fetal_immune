We just had our first meeting on this. Chenqu updated me and all the work that has been done so far and summarized the main findings, which are:

- Fetal B1 cells 
- the thymus B cells
- Changes in cell type abundances across time 
- Organ specific celltype signatures (interaction model)

## TO DO

- Uniform annotations (from deep annotations of each dataset)
- Analysis of immuno-poiesis: 
    - Inferring tree of developmental changes
    - Pseudotime VS real time VS organ: can we detect migration of immune cells?
    - Identify bias in progenitors
